# Hackaton NOC\*NSF

## Introduction

You recently started at Fortezza and you got an amazing assignment/. The Dutch Olympic Committee\*Dutch Sports Federation(NOC\*NSF) asked you to give more insight in how the Netherlands performed on the Olympics in the past couple of years. The last years there is heavily invested in some sports, but there was never any insight or information that it delivered the desired the results. To start,  NOC\*NSF would like to have an interactive dashboard where they can show their investments and compare it with the performance of the athletes in the past couple of years. Het NOC\*NSF would really like to start implementing a data warehouse, but for now they only have Excel Files.

NOC\*NSF had a long selection process and will use Microsoft Power BI as their main source for visualising the data. The purpose is not to only generate insight in the past performances, but also give advise on what NOC\*NSF can do in the future to get on top of the leaderboard.

Het NOC\*NSF gave you the following files:

-	‘Prestaties per atleet’ – shows the data of all of the performances from all olympic athletes from 1900 to 2018;
-	‘Budgetten’ – Here the board gave you the budget they had for the sports they invested in for 2014 to 2018;
-	‘noc_regio’ – The mapping table for regions to countries;

## Assignment
- Load the files in Power BI and create a data model, so the Data Analists can create their own reports in a later stage;
- Develop a interactive dashboard that answers the questions the stakeholders have;
- Present your dashboard to the stakeholders from NOC\*NSF.

## Questions from the stakeholders
- Give insight in the past performances and results on the Olympic Games;
- Give insight in the spend budget;
- Give advice on where to invest next to generate better results, short and long term.
